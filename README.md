# UI Libraries spike
## [[Live version]](https://ui-lib-spike.vercel.app/)

### Local:
1. `git clone`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`

### My Choice: 
Headless UI

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Compatibility with tech stack: Astro, React, Typescript
- Ease of integration and customization
- Should contain as many ready-made components as possible that we need to implement
- SSG consistency
- Acceptable community support and documentation
- Performance and scalability
- Developer Experience (last but not least üòÅ)

### TLDR

- **Headless UI**: Ideal for full flexibility in styling and customization with Tailwind CSS. Well-suited for Astro and React with SSG due to its unstyled nature.
- **DaisyUI**: Provides a balance between Tailwind CSS and ready-made components. Easy to use and integrate with Astro and React, compatible with SSG.
- **Ant Design**: Offers a comprehensive suite of components and design consistency, suitable for larger applications but might be overkill for smaller projects and could impact performance due to its size.
- **Chakra UI**: Offers pre-built, accessible components with good SSG support. It‚Äôs easy to customize with Tailwind CSS, but dynamic theming might require extra setup.
- **Radix UI**: Lightweight, unstyled components perfect for custom styling with Tailwind CSS. Works great with SSG due to its minimal impact on performance.
- **React Aria**: Focuses on accessibility and logic without styling. Seamlessly integrates with Tailwind CSS and SSG but requires more effort to create full components.
- **NextUI**: Provides customizable, modern components that can be styled with Tailwind CSS. Works well with SSG but has a smaller component library.

### Known Issues

- **Ant Design**:
  - Requires considerable effort to style components; issues may arise during configuration, and theme wrappers may have no effect, resulting in poorly styled components.
  
- **DaisyUI**:
  - Uses default HTML elements as a base, which has its drawbacks.
  - Inputs used as checkboxes may not be styled as per documentation due to style conflicts.
  - Styling Inputs and Select components requires more work beyond applying Tailwind classes.

- **Headless UI**:
  - Pleasant to work with due to its lack of predefined styles and its responsiveness to Tailwind classes. Recommended in the Astro documentation.
  - **Relatively small number of ready-made components, but covers essential needs (Atoms)**.
  - Can be written with Tailwind or using specialized libraries.
 
- **Chakra UI**:

  - May require extra configuration for theme hydration during SSG.
  - Some components need additional customization with Tailwind CSS for a fully unique design.\
    
- **Radix UI**:

  - Styling from scratch can be time-consuming since it's completely unstyled.
  - Limited set of components compared to other libraries.

- **React Aria**:

  - No pre-styled components, so UI must be built from the ground up.
  - Requires more time to fully integrate with Tailwind CSS.

- **NextUI**:
