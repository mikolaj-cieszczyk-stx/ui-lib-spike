# UI Libraries spike
## [[Live version]](https://ui-lib-spike.vercel.app/)

### Local:
1. `git clone`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`

### My Choice: Headless UI

### TLDR

- **Headless UI**: Ideal for full flexibility in styling and customization with Tailwind CSS. Well-suited for Astro and React with SSG due to its unstyled nature.
- **DaisyUI**: Provides a balance between Tailwind CSS and ready-made components. Easy to use and integrate with Astro and React, compatible with SSG.
- **Ant Design (Antd)**: Offers a comprehensive suite of components and design consistency, suitable for larger applications but might be overkill for smaller projects and could impact performance due to its size.

### Known Issues

- **Ant Design (Antd)**:
  - Requires considerable effort to style components; issues may arise during configuration, and theme wrappers may have no effect, resulting in poorly styled components.
  
- **DaisyUI**:
  - Uses default HTML elements as a base, which has its drawbacks.
  - Inputs used as checkboxes may not be styled as per documentation due to style conflicts.
  - Styling Inputs and Select components requires more work beyond applying Tailwind classes.

- **Headless UI**:
  - **Best Experience**: Most pleasant to work with due to its lack of predefined styles and its responsiveness to Tailwind classes. Recommended in the Astro documentation.
  - **Component Library**: Relatively small number of ready-made components, but covers essential needs (Atoms).
  - **Complex Components**: Can be written with Tailwind or using specialized libraries.

## Comparison: Headless UI vs DaisyUI vs Ant Design

### 1. Headless UI

**Description**:
Headless UI is a library of unstyled, accessible UI components for React and Vue, focusing on the logic and accessibility of components.

**Advantages**:
- **Flexibility**: Components come with no styles, allowing complete customization using Tailwind CSS or other styling tools.
- **Accessibility**: Designed with accessibility in mind (ARIA), which is important for creating accessible applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with Tailwind CSS, beneficial for an Astro project using React.
- **SSG Compatibility**: Components are server-side rendered during static page generation, fully compatible with SSG in Astro.

**Disadvantages**:
- **No Built-in Styles**: Requires creating your own styles, which can increase implementation time.
- **Smaller Component Library**: May offer fewer pre-built components compared to some other libraries.

### 2. DaisyUI

**Description**:
DaisyUI is a plugin for Tailwind CSS that provides a set of styled, ready-to-use UI components.

**Advantages**:
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Designed as an extension to Tailwind CSS, making it easy to integrate with projects that use Tailwind.
- **Ready-made Components**: Offers a range of pre-styled components that can accelerate development.
- **Ease of Use**: Quick to implement due to the availability of pre-styled components.
- **SSG Compatibility**: Components work well with SSG since they are essentially styled versions of Tailwind components and render effectively during static site generation.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Less Flexibility**: Predefined styles might not be as flexible as starting from scratch with a library like Headless UI.
- **Potential Bloat**: May include styles or components that are not needed, potentially increasing the size of your project.

### 3. Ant Design (Antd)

**Description**:
Ant Design (Antd) is a comprehensive UI framework that offers a wide range of styled components and design patterns for React.

**Advantages**:
- **Rich Component Library**: Provides a large number of well-designed, pre-built components.
- **Design System**: Includes a consistent design system, useful for large-scale applications.
- **Good Documentation**: Well-documented with a robust ecosystem and community support.
- **SSG Compatibility**: Works well with SSG, as components are server-side rendered and compatible with static site generation processes in Astro.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Heavyweight**: Can be larger in size compared to lighter libraries, which might affect performance.
- **Less Customization**: While Antd offers many components, they are more opinionated in design, which might require extra effort to override default styles.
